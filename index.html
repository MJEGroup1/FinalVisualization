              <h2>Motivation</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Mothers for Justice and Equality (MJE) is a group of activists in the Roxbury area who strive to reduce violence in the Boston community. They put forward the statement: “We share a common purpose to end violence and restore a sense of pride and hope to our communities. We stand in solidarity with those who have lost loved ones to violence, and those who share a vision of a world in which this violence is no longer normal or acceptable.”</p>
            <p>Our motivating question for this project: How has MJE impacted their participants through their programs focused on women empowerment?</p>

          <h2>Data</h2>
        </header>
        <p>MJE provided us with a variety of data to work with, most of which pertained to the enrollment numbers of their different programs. They also shared their yearbook with us, which contained images and stories for the participants in their You Matter program. We decided to use this data to help tell the story of the women of MJE and how they work with the organization to help improve their communities. For our visulation, we combined MJE's You Matter enrollment numbers and number of active alumni from 2013 to 2016 (quantitative data) with the particpants for each year and their stories (categorical data). </p>

        <h3>Interview</h3>
        <p>We met with Sherly and Dominique of Mothers for Justice and Equality (MJE) on the morning of Monday, February 6th at their office in Roxbury. They started off talking about their mission as an organization. In the words of Sherly, they take women that are broken from hardships and lift them up to a place where they can be leaders and regain self-love. MJE offers a variety of workshops and classes, including a leadership workshop and art class that they went over in more details with us. The Healing Through the Arts class is a chance for women to come in and create art pieces based on their stories, visualizing what matters most to them. Meanwhile, the You Matter leadership training program is a series of 4 classes with the goal that hopefully participants will become workshop leaders themselves. This conversion information is actually what we will be focusing on with our data visualizations in addition to general data about the growth in participation.</p>

            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>We began the design of our app by sketching out ideas for different types of visualizations that we could make with the data we were given. These sketches included a variety of different line and bar graphs, most of which compared MJE enrollment numbers in different programs year to year. In the end, we settled on a grouped bar graph that displayed enrollment in the You Matter program and number of active alumni per year.</p>
          <li>
            <span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
            <h3>Mockups</h3>
            <p>After settling on the data and type of chart we wanted to use for our visulization, we began to brainstorm ideas for adding color and interactivity. Since purple is a prominant color in MJE's brand, we deicded to use two shades of it to differentiate the two types of bars on our chart. We chose to use the details on demand technique to make our visualization interactive: when either of the bars for a year are clicked, the MJE awardees for that year and their stories will be shown below the chart.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p>Finally, made a few final tweaks tweaks to our desighn and built then implementation. We decided that it would be best to show all the MJE award recipients, rather than just 3 per year, and made changes to our designs to acommodate this. We then used D3 and javascript to implement our designs.</p>

          <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
          <p>As our data is focused more on the stories of MJE members, we weren't able to make quite as many inferences as we could have with a more expansive data set. However, there are a few conclusions that can be drawn from our visualization. First, both enrollment in MJE's you matter program and number of active alumni have followed a general upward trend over the course of the past few years. Secondly, a significant number of You Matter alumni remain active with the orgnization. Finally, there seems to be a correlation between number of particants in the You Matter program and the increase in active alumni the following year, suggesting the the percentage of returning participants is about the same year-to-year.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Overall, we beleive we made a successful visualization that both displays current trends in MJE's programs and showcases the powerful and emotional stories of the women that make their organization what it is. Looking back, we are especially happy with our choice to display stories of all MJE's awardees, rather than just three per year. We believe that in the future, similar visualizations could be used to show enrollment for other MJE programs</p>
