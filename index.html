  <h1>Motivation</h1>
  <p>Mothers for Justice and Equality (MJE) is a group of activists in the Roxbury area who strive to reduce violence in the Boston community. They put forward the statement: “We share a common purpose to end violence and restore a sense of pride and hope to our communities. We stand in solidarity with those who have lost loved ones to violence, and those who share a vision of a world in which this violence is no longer normal or acceptable.”

  Our motivating question for this project: How has MJE impacted their participants through their programs focused on women empowerment?</p>

  <h1>Data</h1>
  <p>The focus of our project leads us to work with the number of participants in the You Matter Program and the alumni that came out of that program from 2013-2016. We also looked at the stories of the women who were impacted by MJE from 2013-2016.</p>

  <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
  <h3>Interview</h3>
  <p>We met with Sherly and Dominique of Mothers for Justice and Equality (MJE) on the morning of Monday, February 6th at their office in Roxbury. They started off talking about their mission as an organization. In the words of Sherly, they take women that are broken from hardships and lift them up to a place where they can be leaders and regain self-love. MJE offers a variety of workshops and classes, including a leadership workshop and art class that they went over in more details with us. The Healing Through the Arts class is a chance for women to come in and create art pieces based on their stories, visualizing what matters most to them. Meanwhile, the You Matter leadership training program is a series of 4 classes with the goal that hopefully participants will become workshop leaders themselves. This conversion information is actually what we will be focusing on with our data visualizations in addition to general data about the growth in participation.</p>
